#
# Typical Makefile for an Agar application using BSDBuild
# <http://hypertriton.com/bsdbuild>.
# 

# The following directives are required. TOP is the directory that
# contains the "mk" subdirectory which holds the build system files,
# and Makefile.config is generated by the configure script.
TOP=.
include ${TOP}/Makefile.config

# If you want to recurse into subdirectories, use ${SUBDIR}:
# SUBDIR=dir1 dir2

#
# Our executable name (platform-dependent suffices may be added).
#
PROG=	nocsim-gui

#
# Program type (use GUI, CLI or DAEMON) and GUID. Exact implications of
# these parameters are platform-specific.
#
PROG_TYPE="GUI"
PROG_GUID=""

#
# Source files. See the <build.prog.mk> source for a list of recognized
# extensions and programming languages.
#
SRCS=	src/main.c src/grid.c src/interp.c src/simulation.c src/util.c src/vec.c
#SRCS+=	foo.cc foo.m foo.asm

#
# Add the compilation flags required by Agar, and link against the
# Agar-Core and Agar-GUI libraries. The variables ${AGAR_CFLAGS} and
# ${AGAR_LIBS} are set by the configure script. CHECK(foo) directives
# in configure.in will always set ${FOO_CFLAGS} and ${FOO_LIBS}.
#
CFLAGS+=${AGAR_CFLAGS}
LIBS+=	${AGAR_LIBS}

# This is required since we are building a program.
include ${TOP}/mk/build.prog.mk
