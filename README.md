This repository contains a simulator used to compare the relative performance
of various Network On Chip routing algorithms and topographies.

This project is supported by a University of South Carolina Magellan Apprentice
grant.

## Key Features

* Performance (**TODO**: add performance numbers here)
* Support for simulating arbitrary, possibly heterogenous network topographies
* Reproduceability: output is always deterministic (if a seed is configured
  explicitly)
* Simple, easy to parse and generate input/output formats

## Input Format
